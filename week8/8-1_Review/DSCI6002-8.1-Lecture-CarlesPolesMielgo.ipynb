Information from the 50 US states plus the District of Columbia (DC) was studied to identify the factors associated with the rate of ER visits. Data on ER visits per year per 1,000 inhabitants, health insurance coverage (%), poverty rate (%), unemployment rate (%), non-citizenship status (%), hospital expenses per inpatient day, teen birth rate per 1,000 for ages 15-19, adults who are overweight/obese (%) and who smoke (%) were collected for each of these 51 areas.
